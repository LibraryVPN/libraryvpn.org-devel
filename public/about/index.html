    <p>People are increasingly concerned by attacks on their online security and privacy. Those who cannot afford broadband access in their home have to rely on free public wifi hotspots where security can be minimal and there are no built in security or privacy protection. Even those who can afford their own internet service have reason to worry about applications abusing their access to gather information and sell it for profit.</p>

<p>Libraries already provide internet access to a wide variety of people, especially to economically vulnerable populations and those who are not technologically sophisticated. Patrons who rely on this service benefit from the security and privacy the libraries provide, but only so long as they are physically within the library.</p>

<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide a solution to this problem by securely routing all traffic from your device through your VPN provider to the internet. This encrypted tunnel ensures that no one on the local network, or on the network path between you and your VPN provider, can sniff your traffic to see where you are connecting to, how long you are spending there, and even (for non HTTPS connections) all of the information send to and from websites.</p>

<p>However, there are several problems with current VPN offerings.</p>

<p>First, all reliable VPN solutions require a monthly fee. This puts them out of reach of those who are most vulnerable to exploitation. They are already in the position of using publicly available internet connections which puts their security and privacy at risk, and because of their financial circumstances they cannot take advantage of the technology which can protect them.</p>

<p>The second problem is that using a VPN requires people to place their trust in whatever VPN company they use. Some (especially free solutions) have proven <a href="https://research.csiro.au/ng/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/2016/08/paper-1.pdf">not to be worthy of that trust</a> by leaking or even outright selling customer data or containing malware. These companies are taking advantage of vulnerable populations who are unable to afford more expensive solutions or who do not have the knowledge to protect themselves. This creates a situation of only having security and privacy available to those who can afford it and have the knowledge to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Libraries are ideally positioned to help with this situation. Libraries historically have worked to provide privacy and security to people, are located in almost every community in the United States and enjoy a high level of trust from the public. Libraries also care deeply about providing services to all members of their community, regardless of financial circumstances. Some might object to public libraries hosting software that allows people to be anonymous online, but many mainstream sources such as the <a href="https://freedom.press/training/choosing-a-vpn/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-you-need-a-vpnand-how-to-choose-the-right-one-1537294244">Wall Street Journal</a>, and the <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> all agree that using a VPN is an important part of maintaining privacy and security on the internet today.</p>

<p>By hosting a VPN service for their patrons, libraries will ensure that all patrons will have access to a trustworthy provider who will not sell their data, and will actively work to protect their privacy and security. The American Library Association’s Code of ethics reads, in part, “We protect each library user&rsquo;s right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.” LibraryVPN will provide libraries with another tool to accomplish this.</p>
