LibraryVPN is an IMLS funded project. It is being developed by a partnership of libraries including [the Lebanon Public Libraries](https://leblibrary.com), [the Westchester Library System](https://www.westchesterlibraries.org/), and T.J. Lamanna (of the Cherry Hill Public Library) working with [LEAP](https://leap.se/). This software is free and opensource, so anyone who wishes to can install it and run it free of charge. We are currently investigated the possibility of a hosted version of this software for libraries that wish to use it, but don't want to host it for themselves.
