There are several problems with current VPN offerings. 

First, all reliable VPN solutions require a monthly fee. This puts them out of reach of those who are most vulnerable to exploitation. They are already in the position of using publicly available internet connections which puts their security and privacy at risk, and because of their financial circumstances they cannot take advantage of the technology which can protect them. 

The second problem is that using a VPN requires people to place their trust in whatever VPN company they use. Some (especially free solutions) have proven [not to be worthy of that trust](https://research.csiro.au/ng/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/2016/08/paper-1.pdf) by leaking or even outright selling customer data or containing malware. These companies are taking advantage of vulnerable populations who are unable to afford more expensive solutions or who do not have the knowledge to protect themselves. This creates a situation of only having security and privacy available to those who can afford it and have the knowledge to protect themselves.
