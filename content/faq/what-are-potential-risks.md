If you are self-hosting LibraryVPN you should be aware that anything a patron does while connected to the VPN will appear to come from your IP address. This is already the case when patrons use a libraries public internet or WIFI so this shouldn't be too big of a change for libraries. Like when patrons use the public wifi available within the library, they may decide to do bad things while using the library's VPN connection. If this happens the library may be contacted by law enforcement or recieve DMCA takedown notices if the VPN connection is used to pirate content. 

We believe that libraries qualify for the safe harbor provision of the DMCA, so your library should not be liable for this abuse of your network. However, this does not constitute legal advice and your library should consult with your legal counsel to decide if this is an accetable risk to your institution. Please note, that anyone could already do these things since libraries provide public internet and wifi. This isn't unique to VPN's. The only difference is that now they will be able to do it from outside of range of library wifi.
