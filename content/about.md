## Library VPN 
LibraryVPN is a free and open source software project that allows libraries to host a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for their patrons. 

Patrons will download an easy to use client for their Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. They will then connect using their library card to have access to a free, high quality, and secure VPN from a provider that they know that they can trust, their local public library.

Public libraries get to activily help protect the privacy of their community members and promote intellectual freedom by hosting this software. They will help to protect the economically vulnerable who can't afford to pay for their own VPN and the less technical who may not know how to safely select a VPN provider.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants
LibraryVPN is built on proven open source solutions including OpenVPN, the gold standard for VPN security. The LEAP project has a proven track record of building secure software which has been used by activist organizations such as [RiseUp](https://riseup.net) for years. LibraryVPN builds on these projects by adding an authentication layer using the SIP2 protocol to allow patrons to use their library cards to log into the VPN client

## Publically funded, Always free
LibraryVPN was initially funded through a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. As a project that started out publically funded we are committed that the code will always remain free and open source so you can use it without worry.
