LibraryVPN is currently under active development. At the moment, the software is at an Alpha stage of maturity and not ready for general use. In an effort to test the software to get it ready for everyone to use it we are currently recruiting libraries to be part of our Beta program.

This program will start in the 3rd quarter of 2020 and should go for six months. Libraries wishing to participate will work with our technical personel to deploy an instance of the LibraryVPN software for their library. We would like to get a mixture of libraries that wish to deploy within their own datacenter (on-premises), in the cloud, and using a hosted offering.

Libraries who are interested will need to make a commitment to use the LibraryVPN service, have patrons and staff use it, and to participate in regular calls with project staff to give feedback on the software.
